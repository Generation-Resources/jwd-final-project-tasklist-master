# Task 2:  Implement your Wireframes using Bootstrap

## Description

* Implement the basic HTML structure of your Wireframes design.
* Create a private Github repository for your project that is shared with your instructor.

> #### Tools
>
> * [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
> * [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Walkthrough

### Step 0: Create a private GitHub repository

Create a GitHub repository and invite your groupmates as collaborators. Set branch protection rules so that no one can push changes without making a pull request.

### Step 1: Create the page structure

In this step, we'll create a basic HTML structure and include [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/).

1. Create a new file called `index.html` inside your project folder.
2. Create a new folder called `assets`, within that folder, create a folder called `css`, within the *css folder*, create a file called `style.css`
3. Link your `styles.css` file inside the `index.html` .

### Step 2: Implementing your Task Planner Wireframes

Go through the different [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/alerts/) and select the ones that are more similar
to your wireframes structure created on Task 1.

1. Add the selected components to your HTML page.
2. Implement your Task planner form that contains the required fields:

* Name
* Description
* AssignedTo
* DueDate
* Status

> #### Useful Resources for this step
>
> * [Bootstrap forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/forms/overview/)

> #### Test Your Code
>
> Now is a good chance to test your page, open your `index.html` on your favorite browser and verify it looks and works as expected.

## Results

We've now set up the `index.html` page, created with Bootstrap!

Your task should meet the assesment criteria in the **Final Project - Scorecard Rubric**.
