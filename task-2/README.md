## Walkthrough

### Step 0: Create a private GitHub repository

Create a private GitHub repository that is shared among your groupmates and your instructor (Phillip-Generation). 

### Step 1: Create the page structure

In this step, we'll create a basic HTML structure and include [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/).

1. Create a new file called `index.html` inside your project folder.
2. Create a new file called `styles.css` and put this file inside a folder called `css`inside your project folder.
3. Include your `styles.css` file inside the `index.html` page.
3. Create a new Github repo and add, commit and push your files.

### Step 2: Implementing your Task Planner Wireframes

Go through the different [Bootstrap components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/alerts/) and select the ones that are more similar 
to your wireframes structure created on Task 1.

1. Add the selected components to your HTML page.
2. Implement your Task planner form that contains the required fields:
* Name
* Description
* AssignedTo
* DueDate
* Status

> - [Bootstrap forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/forms/)


> #### Test Your Code!
> Now is a good chance to test your page, open your `index.html` on your favorite browser and verify it looks and works as expected.

## Results

We've now set up the `index.html` page, created with Bootstrap!
