2. Add field inside the card for the task name.
3. Add field inside the card for the task description.
4. Add field inside the card for the task assigned to.
5. Add field inside the card for the task due date.

### Step 2: Implementing the task list

1. Add a [list group](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/list-group/) to the `index.html`.
2. Add your sample task card inside the list.

### Step 3: Adding your sample data

1. Create 5 different task examples.
2. Add your 5 cards inside the list group created on step 2.
